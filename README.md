In this assignment, I am tasked to find the most optimal options for the business owner for their AI clinic. Requirement is as follow:

The AI Pre-diagnosis system is an integration of medical devices with Artificial Intelligence (AI).
It can produce a comprehensive medical report within one minute. 
You can assume that the time taken to perform the AI Pre-diagnosis is negligible for the willing patients and will not add to the overall consultation time.
If a patient is willing to undergo the AI Pre-diagnosis before the physical examination by the doctor, it would reduce the doctor’s consultation time by 75%.
You are tasked to introduce AI Pre-diagnosis to a clinic to enhance its operations. The clinic starts and ends its operation at 0900 hrs and 1300 hrs respectively.
The patients are being served by a singleserver queue system whereby the interarrival time follows an exponential function with a mean of 5 minutes.
The average consultation time for a patient would be 20 mins. 

In order to encourage patients to undergo the AI Pre-diagnosis, the clinic will offer a discount on the medical fees for willing patients.
The average medical fees (before discount) for each patient is $80. 

There are 4 different discount options that the clinic can adopt:

• Option 1 - Discount of $2. The patient has a 20% chance of opting for AI Pre-diagnosis.

• Option 2 - Discount of $4. The patient has a 30% chance of opting for AI Pre-diagnosis. 

• Option 3 - Discount of $10. The patient has a 40% chance of opting for AI Pre-diagnosis. 

• Option 4 - Discount of $14. The patient has a 65% chance of opting for AI Pre-diagnosis.

For every one hour of running the clinic after 1300 hrs, the clinic has to incur $120. Examine the results and recommend the option that the clinic should adopt with supporting reasonings.
